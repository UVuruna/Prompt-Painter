# GUI

**Script:** [GUI (script)](gui.py)

## Purpose
The owner's front door — a themed tkinter window over the same
engine the CLI uses, built for unattended batches: queue the
collections, press Start, go ride a bike. A `clam`-themed ttk look
(setup_style) gives the whole app consistent fonts, padding and
accent colours; a reusable `ScrollFrame` backs the selection list
and a `ttk.Treeview` is the dashboard's finished-collection table.

## The window

- **Collections** — a QUEUE of one or more prompt `.md` files (each
  file is one COLLECTION — a set of images to make: a theme, an icon
  set, a landscape series …; Add / Remove / Clear). Each site works
  through the queue in order, closing collection after collection;
  broken files are reported and dropped, never half-driven. Two
  queued files that share a filename are refused (their progress and
  report would collide).
- **Output** — the folder; images save DIRECTLY to
  `<out>/<site>/<drop-path>` (no approval step).
- **Sites** — Gemini / ChatGPT checkboxes; both ticked = both run
  IN PARALLEL, one thread and one tab each. Beside each site sits
  its own **background dropdown** (`transparent` / `white` /
  `none`), preselected to the site's default — ChatGPT
  transparent, Gemini white. Gemini's three laws ride along
  automatically: the aspect law picked per prompt (badges 1:1,
  TALL lancets portrait), the background, and no reflections.
- **Background fix** — runs the in-house remover after every save.
- **Report txt** — the per-theme report beside the images:
  start/finish timestamps, per-image generate + process times,
  original → final resolution, file size, extra actions (REMOVE
  BG), averages and totals.
- **Safer retry on refusal** — ON by default: on a SAFETY refusal,
  re-send the item ONCE with an allegory-framing preamble before
  giving up (then it just moves on — rework the prompt later).
- **Open Chrome (login)** — launches the automation Chrome
  (dedicated `chrome-profile/`; log in once, sessions persist).
- **Check sheets** — parses the whole queue into the log.
- **Select images...** — the tick list, PER SITE: every sheet's
  items with one checkbox column per site (all/none toggles per
  sheet), so ChatGPT and Gemini can run different image lists.
  Already-done items (per the site's progress under the current
  output folder) show disabled; sheet-ADVISED items (REUSE /
  not-approved sections) show unticked with the ⚠ reason — tick
  them to generate them anyway. Without any explicit ticks, a run
  skips advised items by default. Rows are COLOR-CODED: green =
  done on both sites (olive = done on one), red = SUPERSEDED
  advice, orange = other advice (not approved / REUSE), default =
  pending.
- **BG removal only...** — standalone background removal, in
  place, over any existing folder (confirmation first;
  already-transparent and unclear images are skipped untouched).
- **Start / Stop** — Stop is graceful: each site finishes its
  current item; everything finished is already saved.
- **Pause / Action delay** — both are random FROM–TO ranges: the
  pause between prompts (fractional seconds) and the human-like
  hesitation between UI steps (click → paste → send, default
  0.2–0.6 s — never instant).
- **Instructions** — opens an IN-APP viewer of the sheet-authoring
  guide (`instructions.md`) — light Markdown formatting, selectable
  read-only text, and a **Copy all (for AI)** button — so a
  non-programmer never needs a code editor.
- **Two views** (tabs): the **Dashboard** and the **Log
  (detailed)** (timestamped `[HH:MM:SS]`, both sites interleaved
  with `[gemini]` / `[chatgpt]` prefixes). A SAFETY refusal skips
  only that image (REFUSED in log + report; a rerun retries it). A
  quota stop (`TERMINAL STATE`) stops only that site's queue — the
  other continues; the next Start resumes what remains.

## The Dashboard
Two scrollable columns, one `DashPanel` per site, fed ONLY by the
runner's structured events (never by log-parsing):

- **Task** — a whole-run progress bar and `done / total
  (done/collections)` across every queued collection (pre-counted
  at Start by `_plan`, which mirrors the runner's queue rule).
- **File / Image** — the current collection file, the current
  image, and a per-collection progress bar.
- **Stats table** — two columns, `This one` and `Whole run`, over
  Done, Refused, **AI generate avg** (SEND → image), **Our time
  avg** (save + bgfix + pause — "sve se računa"), Tempo (/h) and
  ETA. Title/value pairs, not one crammed line.
- **Collections (running + done)** — a `ttk.Treeview` TABLE, three
  levels deep, column headers (Name · Done · AI · Ours · Res · Time
  · Size), both scrollbars, everything column-aligned:
  1. **Collection** — `Done` (done/total), `Time` (wall), `Size`.
  2. **Folder** (the drop-path directory) — `Done` (count in that
     folder), `Time`, `Size`, same columns as the collection.
  3. **Image** — `AI` (generate), `Ours` (fills after its pause),
     `Res`, `Size`.
  The RUNNING collection appears live and open, images streaming in
  under their folder as they save; it collapses when done.

## Threading
One worker thread per site; each creates its own Playwright
instance and `SiteDriver` (sync Playwright is per-thread) and
walks the theme queue sequentially. Workers touch the window ONLY
through a queue drained on the tk timer (`_drain_queue` via
`root.after`) — every widget mutation runs on the main thread.
