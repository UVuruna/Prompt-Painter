# GUI

**Script:** [GUI (script)](gui.py)

## Purpose
The owner's front door — a themed tkinter window over the same
engine the CLI uses, built for unattended batches: queue the
collections, press a site's Start, go ride a bike. The widget
stack (2026-07-18) is **customtkinter rounded controls over a
ttkbootstrap `darkly` base — the same mix RHMH uses**: every
button is a `CTkButton` with RHMH's strong corner radius (12 px,
hover = the same colour darkened to 0.75), the output path field a
rounded bordered `CTkEntry`, the pace fields compact `Spinner`s
(ONE reusable class — a rounded `CTkFrame` holding
[−] [entry] [+]: ~24 px pads, step 1 s for the pauses, 0.1 s for
the action delays, direct typing still allowed and validated on
Start, never below 0), the background / New-chat dropdowns rounded
`CTkComboBox`es, the option toggles `CTkSwitch`es, and each site's
whole control set an `AgentPanel` labelframe with the site's LOGO
in its header. All
their colours come from the active theme (see **Theming** below) via
the `rounded_button` / `rounded_entry` / `rounded_combo` /
`rounded_switch` factories and `_button_colors` (semantic kinds:
secondary, success Start, danger outline Stop, info Copy, outlines,
flat link and ▶/▼ expander) — every CTk colour kwarg is a fixed
`(day, night)` tuple, so a single
`ctk.set_appearance_mode()` flip repaints all CTk controls with zero
re-walk. The SOLID kinds (secondary / success / danger / info) draw
their fill AND label from the per-theme `config.BUTTON_FILL` /
`BUTTON_TEXT` pairs (owner 2026-07-19): the DAY shade differs from NIGHT
for every kind and the neutral `secondary` is a LIGHT sand fill with
DARK text on day (it used to borrow the dark warm-grey palette key and
render brown on the cream window); coloured kinds keep a white label in
both themes. every factory also pins `bg_color` to the active window
background so rounded corners never show a foreign gray on ttk
parents. Two smooth-field fixes
live in the factories (2026-07-18): `_untheme_inner_entry`
unsubscribes the `tkinter.Entry` INSIDE every CTkEntry/CTkComboBox
from ttkbootstrap's constructor-hook re-styling and drops its
`highlightthickness=1` square ring (the "lighter square inside the
rounded field" defect), and `EdgeIconButton`
(`rounded_button(..., icon_edge=True)`, the stacked
Add…/Remove/Clear queue buttons) re-grids CTkButton's internal 5x5
layout so the ICON pins to the left edge while the TEXT centers in
the remaining width. What stays ttk:
the `Treeview` table, `Notebook` tabs, striped progressbars, round
scrollbars, labels/frames — darkly widgets CTk has no better
equivalent for — plus the whole Select tree (frames, wrapped
labels, per-site checkbuttons — deliberately light widgets; NO CTk
inside a scroll canvas, since a CTkButton is a drawn canvas that
re-renders on every configure). `setup_style` only adds
the few named label styles the base theme lacks (re-run on every
flip); `skin_text` / `skin_listbox` / `skin_canvas` /
`skin_toplevel` colour the plain tk widgets from `Style().colors`
AND register them in the `THEMED_TK` role registry so a flip
re-tints them; the semantic STATUS colours (done, olive one-site,
advice, superseded, code text) live PER THEME in `THEMES[*].status`
and are read live through `status(role)`. A reusable `ScrollFrame` backs the selection
tree, WRAPS the whole main window (see **Collapse & global scroll**),
and a `ttk.Treeview` is the dashboard's collection table.
`ScrollFrame` COALESCES its scrollregion: a body `<Configure>`
only schedules ONE `after_idle` `bbox('all')` pass, so an expand
that grids dozens of children costs one geometry scan, not one per
child; `suspend_scrollregion` / `resume_scrollregion` pause even
that during a bulk build (the Select tree's Expand-all) so the
O(content) `bbox` scan runs ONCE at the end, not once per chunk.
An optional `fill_height=True` (the whole-window wrap uses it)
keeps the body window AT LEAST as tall as the canvas — so a child
packed `expand=True` (the Dashboard notebook) fills the viewport
when the content is shorter than the window — behind a change-guard
that breaks the itemconfigure→`<Configure>`→recompute loop
(`winfo_reqheight` is invariant under the forced height, so one
settle converges); `refresh()` re-fits after a collapse/expand.
`ScrollFrame` also DEBOUNCES the resize re-fit (owner 2026-07-19,
tightened 2026-07-20): customtkinter re-renders on every intermediate
`<Configure>`, so a window drag / maximize used to run the
fill-height + scrollregion scan per frame (visible jank). A canvas
`<Configure>` now only REMEMBERS the newest width and re-arms a
settle timer (`_arm_settle`); the `_resizing` flag gates `_on_body`'s
per-frame scheduling, and the WHOLE re-fit — the body-width
itemconfigure (`_apply_width`), fill-height and the scrollregion scan
— runs ONCE via `_settle` ~`RESIZE_SETTLE_MS` (150 ms) after the LAST
`<Configure>` ("wait for mouse release"). The width used to stay live
per frame, but every width write reflows the body and fires a
`<Configure>` into each CTk child — measured over a synthetic 30-step
drag: 30 width writes → 55 CTk `_draw` re-renders before vs 0 and 0
during the drag now (one width write + 2 scans + 5 redraws on
settle); the first configure of a settled window still applies
immediately so the viewport never opens with a dead strip. Trade-off
(owner accepted): mid-drag the content freezes at its pre-drag width
— a window-bg strip grows (or the content clips) at the right edge —
and snaps to fit 150 ms after release. The drag stream itself also
buffers the dashboard events (see **Threading**).
The module-level `folder_of(drop_path)` (a drop path's
POSIX parent, `(root)` fallback) is the shared L2 folder identity
for both the dashboard tree and the Select window.

**Icons** (2026-07-18) are SVG-FIRST: the owner's
`assets/icons/*.svg` (`add` / `remove` / `clear` on the queue
buttons, `start` (play) on Start, `right` on the dashboard's Show
button, `chatGPT` / `gemini` as the site-switch logos) rasterized
through Qt's `QSvgRenderer` (PySide6 — already the monorepo build
pipeline's SVG engine; a lazy, never-exec()-ed `QGuiApplication`
serves only offscreen painting) at 4x the target size and
LANCZOS-downscaled for crispness. PNG stays the fallback for icons
with no svg (`web` on Open Chrome, `ai` on DocWindow's Copy) AND
for svgs QtSvg cannot render: QtSvg implements the SVG *Tiny*
profile, so a file using `clipPath`/`mask`/`filter` (Illustrator
raster-trace exports — `gemini.svg` is 12 embedded rasters under
28 clipPaths) is detected by tag-sniffing the bytes and loaded
from its pre-rasterized `.png` sibling instead (`gemini.png` was
rendered ONCE from the svg via chromium, transparent, 512 px).
The module-level `icon(name, size=20)` loader resolves beside
`gui.py` (never the CWD), returns a `CTkImage`, and caches per
(name, size) in `_ICONS` for the process lifetime. A missing icon
— or a Tiny-unrenderable svg with no png sibling — raises
`FileNotFoundError` loudly (root Rule #1); buttons keep their text
(`compound="left"`). The five PNGs the svgs replaced
(add/clear/remove/right/start) were DELETED (2026-07-18);
`assets/icons/` now holds only the svgs plus `web.png`, `ai.png`
and the `gemini.png` sibling.

**Global font zoom** (2026-07-18) — CSS-rem style: ONE root size
(`FONT_BASE`, default 10, clamped 7–20) and a role table of
multipliers (`FONT_ROLES`: root 1.0, bold 1.0, head 1.1, title
1.6, spin 1.2, mono 0.9, doc_h1 1.5, doc_h2 1.2 — the exact
pre-zoom ratios). Every font in the GUI — the ttk styles, all CTk
factories/Spinner, the Treeview body+heading fonts, the queue
Listbox, the log Text, DocWindow's body and tags — pulls a SHARED
font object per role from the registry (`tk_font(role)` named tk
fonts / `ctk_font(role)` CTkFonts), so `set_font_base` rescales
the whole window with one `.configure(size=…)` per role; only the
Treeview rowheight (root x 2.4) is re-applied explicitly.
Shortcuts, bound on `all` (SelectWindow/DocWindow answer too, and
new Toplevels open at the current zoom because the shared fonts
ARE the current zoom): **Ctrl+MouseWheel** up/down,
**Ctrl+Numpad +/-**, plain **Ctrl+plus/minus** (and Ctrl+equal
for keyboards without a numpad). The wheel handler returns
"break" and is also bound on the Text/Listbox/Treeview class tags
so Ctrl+wheel zooms without ALSO scrolling the widget under the
pointer.

**Collapse & global scroll** (2026-07-18) — two window-wide
reachability fixes:

- **Collapsible controls** — a `▾ Controls` toggle (top strip, left
  of the Day/Night switch) collapses the WHOLE upper control area
  (the Collections queue, Output row, both `AgentPanel` bodies and
  the in-place-tools button row — all held in `self._controls_box`)
  down to a thin per-agent strip (`self._compact_box`): one
  `[logo] Name [Start][Stop]` cluster per site, so the Dashboard/Log
  notebook takes the full height while the owner watches a run.
  Nothing is destroyed — the swap is `pack_forget` ↔
  `pack(before=self.notebook)`, so every StringVar/Spinner/Listbox
  keeps its state and `before=` pins the vertical order regardless of
  build order. `AgentPanel.build_compact()` builds each cluster and
  appends its Start/Stop to the panel's `_button_pairs`; the
  unchanged-signature `set_run_state` loops that list so the compact
  and full buttons ALWAYS share the same filled/outline availability
  and drive the same `_start_site`/`_stop_site`. The button carries the
  **gamepad icon** (`assets/icons/controls.png`, owner 2026-07-19) beside
  the glyph, which flips to `▸ Controls` when collapsed; the state
  persists (`controls_collapsed`). The toggle runs behind the shared
  **`smooth_transition` snapshot cover** (owner 2026-07-20): the swap
  moves the whole upper window, so `_toggle_collapsed` covers it with
  a window snapshot, relayouts hidden behind it and fades the cover
  out over `TRANSITION_FADE_MS` (~260 ms) instead of one hard jump
  (see **Theming — the snapshot cover**).
- **Per-agent Settings gear** (owner 2026-07-19) — each `AgentPanel`
  owns its OWN `⚙ Settings` gear button (`assets/icons/settings.png`, on
  the Start/Stop row) that shows/hides THAT agent's collapsible
  **fine-tune** area — its **pause** range, its **action-delay** range,
  AND its **Upscale gate (this site)** block (min W / min H / aspect FROM
  / aspect TO) — independently of the other site. HIDDEN by DEFAULT so
  the panel stays compact; `_toggle_settings` flips the panel's own
  `settings_collapsed_var` and `_apply_finetune_visibility` packs ↔
  `pack_forget`s the panel's `_finetune_box` (built at the panel's bottom)
  and swaps the `▾/▸ Settings` caret — the reveal runs behind the same
  `smooth_transition` snapshot cover as the Controls toggle (owner
  2026-07-20), since it moves everything below the panel. The state is
  per agent, persisted in
  that agent's settings (`settings_collapsed`, default collapsed) and
  reflected on load. There is NO global Settings toggle (the 0.0.079
  top-strip one was removed). Collapsing the whole Controls area hides
  the panels — gear and all — as before.
- **Whole-window vertical scroll** — the entire content lives in ONE
  `fill_height` `ScrollFrame` (the top strip is pinned OUTSIDE it, so
  the collapse toggle is always reachable). When the content exceeds
  the window height (a short window, or the owner's stale too-tall
  geometry) the outer view scrolls so the bottom buttons / Dashboard
  bottom are never unreachable. **Wheel routing**: the outer view
  keeps `ScrollFrame`'s `<Enter>`/`<Leave>` → `bind_all` pattern
  (per-canvas scoped, correct for the multi-Toplevel app); the inner
  scrollables get a PERMANENT `bind_class('<MouseWheel>')`
  (`_inner_wheel`) on Treeview/Text/Listbox that scrolls that widget
  and returns `"break"`, halting the bindtag chain BEFORE the outer
  `all`-tag handler — so over a dashboard tree / the Log / the
  Collections list the INNER widget scrolls once (never a
  double-scroll), and over anything else the OUTER view scrolls.
  Ctrl+wheel is untouched: `_bind_zoom`'s `<Control-MouseWheel>` on
  the same class tags is more specific than the plain `<MouseWheel>`,
  so a Ctrl event fires only the zoom (no new guard needed).
- **Geometry cap** — `_clamp_geometry` clamps a restored
  `WxH(+X+Y)` to the screen minus `WINDOW_SCREEN_MARGIN_PX` and on to
  an on-screen offset (below `WINDOW_MIN_W/H` it raises to the min;
  unparseable passes through), applied in `_apply_settings`, so a
  stale `1381x2061` (taller than the owner's screen) can never again
  place the window past the screen edge with the bottom unreachable.
- **The root `<Configure>` watcher** (`_on_root_configure`, owner
  2026-07-20) — bound `add="+"` on the root at the END of `__init__`
  (after the saved geometry applies, so startup never arms it), and
  since every child widget carries the toplevel bindtag, its FIRST
  line drops child configures (one identity check per frame — the
  whole added per-frame cost). Two jobs: a **zoomed↔normal state
  change** is the DISCRETE maximize/restore jump — it runs the
  `smooth_transition` cover (mutate = nothing; the WM already resized
  us, the relayout settles behind the cover) and can never fire
  mid-drag because the state stays `normal` through a whole drag; a
  **same-state size change** marks a continuous drag active and
  re-arms a `RESIZE_SETTLE_MS` settle — while active, `_drain_queue`
  BUFFERS `__event__` messages (dashboard tree/label updates) into
  `_pending_events` and `_resize_settled` flushes them in order on
  release, so a live run stops re-rendering tree rows per drag frame
  (measured: 30 mid-drag events handled during the drag before, 0
  after — all 30 on settle). This is the ONLY root-level `<Configure>`
  bind; the audit found no other per-frame `<Configure>` work in
  gui.py beyond `ScrollFrame` (debounced above) and the Select
  window's wrap re-flow (now also settle-debounced).

## The window

- **Collections** — a QUEUE of one or more prompt `.md` files (each
  file is one COLLECTION — a set of images to make: a theme, an icon
  set, a landscape series …; **Add…** / **Remove** / **Clear** plus
  **Add folder…** (owner 2026-07-21) — picks a folder and recursively
  queues every `.md` underneath via `config.iter_md_files` (mirrors
  `iter_images`), however deep it is nested. All four buttons share
  ONE append/de-dup/insert body, `_queue_sheets(paths)` (de-dup is by
  full PATH, so two same-named sheets in different sub-folders both
  queue — see the filename-collision refusal below); `_add_sheets`
  (the file picker) and `add_generated_sheet` (the AI sheet
  generator's queue-one-sheet call) both reduce to a call into it —
  Rule #5). Each site works
  through the queue in order, closing collection after collection;
  broken files are reported and dropped, never half-driven. Two
  queued files that share a filename are refused (their progress and
  report would collide).
- **Output** — the folder; images save DIRECTLY to
  `<out>/<site>/<drop-path>` (no approval step).
- **The two AGENT PANELS** (2026-07-18, full per-agent
  separation) — ChatGPT and Gemini each get their OWN
  `AgentPanel` labelframe (site logo in the header) holding
  everything below the shared Output line: the **background
  dropdown** (`transparent` / `white` / `none`, preselected to the
  site's default — ChatGPT transparent, Gemini white; Gemini's
  three laws still ride along automatically), the **Style dropdown**
  (owner 2026-07-19 — one of the 7 `config.STYLES`, default `None`;
  a PRIMARY per-generation choice so it sits in the always-visible
  area near Background / New chat, NOT under the gear; its clause is
  appended at the very END of that site's `prompt_suffix`, after the
  background rule + Gemini laws, and it is passed into the worker via
  `partial(prompt_suffix, key, background, style=...)`), the three composable
  **post-save switches** — `BG removal`, `Crop`, `Upscale` (all ON
  by default; each site's post-save pipeline runs exactly ITS
  ticked steps, in that order, loud on failure but never killing
  the run), **Report txt**, **Safer retry**, **Continue nudge**
  (owner 2026-07-20 — ON by default; on a stuck `NoImage` response
  the runner sends `CONTINUE_NUDGE` once into the same chat to un-stick
  ChatGPT before giving up, passed to `run_sheet(continue_nudge=…)`),
  the **New chat** mode,
  its own **Start / Pause / Stop** trio (owner 2026-07-21 adds
  **Pause** between them — a plain neutral `btn_pause` whose LABEL
  alone flips Pause ↔ Resume, wired to the shared `_toggle_pause_job`;
  see **Pause** below), and its own **⚙ Settings gear**
  (owner 2026-07-19). The gear reveals THIS agent's collapsible
  **fine-tune** area (`_finetune_box`, hidden by default): the **pause**
  Spinner range, the **action delay** Spinner range, and the **Upscale
  gate (this site)** block — four Spinner fields (min W, min H, aspect
  FROM, aspect TO) that `panel.upscale_params()` feeds into THAT site's
  pipeline `upscale_if_small` when its Upscale switch is on. All three
  moved UNDER the gear (they were formerly always-visible / global);
  `_toggle_settings` + `_apply_finetune_visibility` show/hide them per
  agent, and Start still validates the four gate values (positive,
  FROM ≤ TO) before spawning. Defaults 800 / 800 / 0.90 / 1.10
  reproduce the old locked gate. A site "participates" in a run by
  being STARTED — there are no site on/off switches any more, and
  one site running never blocks starting the other. Start/Stop
  availability is STYLED (`style_action_button`): an available
  button is FILLED with its colour (solid green Start / solid red
  Stop), an unavailable one is a disabled OUTLINE — re-applied on
  every run-state change (while a quota auto-restart is pending,
  BOTH are available: Start starts earlier, Stop cancels the
  timer).
- **Open Chrome (login)** — launches the automation Chrome with
  both sites' tabs (dedicated `chrome-profile/`; log in once,
  sessions persist).
- **Check sheets** — parses the whole queue into the log AND
  switches the view to the Log tab so the output is immediately
  visible.
- **Select images...** — a PER-SITE 3-LEVEL tree
  (`SelectWindow`): level 1 the COLLECTION (sheet file + theme),
  level 2 the FOLDERS inside it (the drop paths' parent dirs — a
  sheet may have several, e.g. `life` has `tree/` and `animals/`,
  keyed by the shared `folder_of`), level 3 the IMAGE files. Only
  the LEAVES carry checkboxes — one column per site — so ChatGPT
  and Gemini can run different image lists. Every level shows a
  LIVE `selected/total` count per site: the collapsible header
  totals the whole queue per site (accent Head style, e.g.
  `ChatGPT 49/55`), and each collection and folder row shows its
  own `sel/tot`. **Clicking any count is all/none** for that
  scope+site (header = whole site, collection, or folder); it
  flips only the non-done leaves, and every count
  re-derives live. Already-done items — their SAVED FILE exists
  under the current output folder (owner 2026-07-19: file existence,
  no longer a sidecar record) — show green/olive + unticked but
  ENABLED, so re-ticking one REGENERATES (overwrites) a bad image;
  sheet-ADVISED items (REUSE / not-approved sections) show
  unticked with the ⚠ reason truncated — tick them to generate
  them anyway. Without any explicit ticks a run skips advised
  items by default (eager var materialisation is run-safe: the
  default advice-free, not-on-disk set equals the runner's own
  "never opened Select" rule). Leaf names are COLOR-CODED: green =
  done on both sites (olive = done on one), red = SUPERSEDED
  advice, orange = other advice, default = pending — and a
  **colour LEGEND** under the top hint bar spells out those four
  (BOTH DONE / ONE SITE DONE / SUPERSEDED / ADVICE), each label
  painted in its own live status colour so a Day/Night flip
  recolours it too. The window is sized FIT-CONTENT
  (`_fit_content_width`): a bounded `font.measure` sweep over just
  the ~30 L1 collection titles (+ their L2 folder paths, never the
  leaves) picks the width so the widest title stays on ONE line,
  clamped to `[SELECT_MIN_W, screen*DOC_MAX_FRAC]`; the
  `ttk.Label(wraplength=)` follows that width so only genuinely
  over-long names wrap (recomputed on resize/zoom). The two
  fixed-width per-site columns stay aligned however deep a row is.
  **Performance** (the owner's "a collapsible list must not lag"):
  the body is plain ttk only, L1/L2 nodes are always materialised
  (cheap — a few dozen) while L3 leaf rows are BUILT on a folder's
  open and DESTROYED on its close (live widgets track only open
  folders, never accumulating), counts update via ONE coalesced
  `after_idle` recount driven by a dirty flag (a var trace just
  raises the flag — the traces are detached on window close), and
  the scrollregion is coalesced too. **Expand all** would otherwise
  materialise EVERY leaf in one synchronous geometry pass (~280
  wraplength rows ≈ 3 s frozen at the owner's real queue); instead
  it builds FOLDER-ATOMIC chunks across `after()` ticks
  (`SELECT_EXPAND_CHUNK` leaves per tick ≈ 120 ms median block),
  suspends the scrollregion scan for the run, and shows a live
  `Expanding… done/total (pct)` cue (root Rule #10) — the tree
  fills in progressively and the main thread is never blocked; any
  manual toggle / Collapse-all cancels an in-flight expand cleanly
  (folders are atomic, so the tree is always in a consistent
  built-or-not state to stop at). The window opens at the
  fit-content width above and a screen-tall height
  (`screen*DOC_HEIGHT_FRAC`, floored at `SELECT_OPEN_H`) with every
  section COLLAPSED — the L1-title measure is bounded (~30 titles),
  never the old open-time sweep over every leaf.
- **BG removal / Crop / Upscale / Aspect ratio** — the four in-place
  tools (owner 2026-07-19; the three renamed buttons DROPPED "only"),
  each its OWN CONCURRENT JOB with its own worker thread and its own
  dashboard panel — up to all four plus both sites (6 panels) run at
  once. Each button carries the panel's COLOUR + its PNG icon (owner
  2026-07-19, replacing the old emoji: BG removal cyan/teal, Crop amber,
  Upscale violet, Aspect ratio magenta — colours in `config.JOB_COLORS`,
  icons `bg`/`crop`/`upscale`/`aspect` via `config.JOB_LOGO` + `icon()`).
  A click (`_start_tool`)
  refuses a second job of the SAME kind (a messagebox — one job per
  kind), opens the input pick + a confirm, then spawns
  `_run_tool_job` on a daemon thread; the engine function
  (`remove_background` / `crop_transparent` / `upscale_if_small` /
  `change_aspect`) runs over the picked images, in order.
  **BG removal / Crop** pick a FOLDER (`askdirectory`) and run over
  every image under it. **Upscale** (owner 2026-07-19) is folder-based
  too, but first pops `UpscaleParamsDialog` — a modal asking the FOUR
  gate params (min W, min H, aspect FROM, aspect TO), PRE-FILLED with the
  last-used values (`self._upscale_tool_params`, remembered/persisted,
  positive-number + FROM≤TO validation), then runs `upscale_if_small`
  with those params bound. **Aspect ratio** pops the `AspectRatioDialog`
  first — a modal with two positive-integer fields **W** and **H**
  (PRE-FILLED with the last-used ratio `self._aspect_ratio`; first run
  16 : 9), an optional INPUT FILTER (owner 2026-07-19 — a `mode`
  combobox `off` / `IF` / `IF NOT` plus a `from`–`to` W/H range,
  PRE-FILLED from `self._aspect_filter`), and TWO action buttons
  **Folder…** / **Files…** that encode the input choice: a folder can
  hold images of DIFFERENT ratios, so the tool accepts a whole FOLDER
  (`askdirectory` → `_iter_images`) OR individual FILES (`askopenfilenames`,
  multi-select) — the filter is what makes a folder useful (skip the
  already-good ones). `.result` is `{ratio, filter, input}`; the run binds
  `ratio_w/ratio_h` and `filter_from/filter_to/filter_mode` into
  `change_aspect`, and the confirm warns it DEFORMS the N images (a
  non-proportional stretch written in place). Both modals share
  `_ModalToolDialog` (the centre-on-parent placement). A file selection is
  keyed by `config.selection_base_and_rels` (the common-ancestor folder
  + each file's relative path), so picks spanning sub-folders still group
  under their folder node and restore correctly. Each image's ORIGINAL is
  BACKED UP first (`painter/jobtemp.py`, see **Temp / before-after /
  restore**), so `done` = the file was changed (its backup kept,
  before→after measured and shown), REFUSED = the engine said
  "nothing"/"unclear" — nothing to do, its no-op backup dropped (for
  Upscale: failed the gate — aspect outside the chosen FROM–TO or both
  sides already ≥ the chosen min W/H; for Aspect: already at the target
  ratio OR filtered out by the input filter, left byte-unchanged).
  The op is also TIMED (per-image seconds; skipped items add no time).
  "Changed" keys ONLY on the engine ACTUALLY REWRITING the file (a
  "done"), never on the metric size (owner 2026-07-19) — a 3px crop or a
  small BG clear is a genuine, restorable change even though its % is
  tiny, so its backup + before/after must survive. The % itself is now
  rendered by `config.fmt_pct` (2 decimals below 10, 1 decimal from 10),
  so that 3px crop reads `0.24%`, never a rounded-away `0%`. Keying
  "changed" on a resolution/metric change (instead of on the file being
  rewritten) was the old before/after bug for BG removal, which changes
  ALPHA, not dimensions. The engine returns "nothing" for a true
  byte-unchanged no-op (crop: a 0px-change box), so a "done" is always a
  real change. The panel shows the tool's own PARAMETER + timing (below).
- **Stop** — graceful: the site finishes its current item;
  everything finished is already saved.
- **Pause (the toggle button, owner 2026-07-21)** — indefinite, not
  timed: blocks the run BETWEEN items/images until Resume (the same
  button, label flipped) or Stop (Stop always wins over a pending or
  active pause). One toggle PER JOB — pausing ChatGPT never touches
  Gemini or a running tool. See **Pause** further below for the full
  mechanism; not to be confused with the NEXT bullet's pace range,
  which shares the word but is a different, pre-existing feature.
- **Pause / Action delay (the pace RANGES, unrelated to the button
  above)** — both are random FROM–TO ranges: the
  pause between prompts (fractional seconds) and the human-like
  hesitation between UI steps (click → paste → send, default
  0.2–0.6 s — never instant). All four fields per panel are the
  compact `Spinner` units ([−]/[+] step or type directly).
- **Instructions** — opens the sheet-authoring guide
  (`instructions.md`) in the in-app `DocWindow` — light Markdown
  formatting, selectable read-only text, and a **Copy (for AI)**
  button — so a non-programmer never needs a code editor.
  `DocWindow` sizes in TWO modes (replacing the old longest-line
  measure that blew the window near full-screen on a ~200-word
  one-line prompt): the SINGLE-IMAGE prompt viewer (`image_path`
  set) sizes its WIDTH to the IMAGE — native width + `DOC_IMG_PAD_PX`,
  clamped to `screen*DOC_MAX_FRAC` — so the picture shows large and
  the prompt WRAPS into that column above it; every TEXT opening
  (instructions, a collection file, a folder excerpt) uses a
  portrait A4 width (`screen*DOC_HEIGHT_FRAC*DOC_A4_RATIO`, clamped
  `[DOC_MIN_W, screen*DOC_MAX_FRAC]`) so long one-line prompts wrap
  into a readable column. The HEIGHT is fitted to the rendered
  content (`_fit_height` measures the Text's `ypixels` on the first
  `<Map>`, when it is finally laid out) and clamped to
  `screen*DOC_MAX_FRAC`, so a short excerpt shrinks to content while
  a tall medallion / long doc scrolls.
- **The AI row** (owner 2026-07-20, a SECOND toolbar row so the tool
  row never clips at the window minimum) — three buttons over
  [AI Client & Flows](painter/ai.md), all gated by the free Gemini
  key in `settings.json`:
    - **New collection (AI)…** opens `AiSheetDialog` — the owner
      types the request (any language), the model returns a short
      clarifying POLL (first call: the sheet contract + a
      questions-only system prompt), the answers (each skippable)
      feed the second call, and the produced `.md` is validated with
      the REAL parser plus ONE automatic repair round. Valid → saved
      under the project-local `sheets/` (slugged filename, created on
      demand) and ADDED to the Collections queue; still broken → the
      raw md opens in a `DocWindow` for manual fixing and is NOT
      loaded. Non-modal, worker-threaded, progress in the Log.
    - **AI check…** — the batch image checker, its OWN job/panel
      (see `AiCheckPanel` under the Dashboard section).
    - **AI key…** opens `AiKeyWizard` — the guided key onboarding:
      four numbered steps (1. a button opening
      `aistudio.google.com` via `webbrowser`, 2. sign in with any
      Google account, 3. Get API key → Create API key, 4. paste it),
      a **Test key** making one tiny real call on a worker thread
      (OK in green / the loud `AiError` in red), and **Save key**
      persisting it. The wizard ALSO opens AUTOMATICALLY whenever an
      AI feature is invoked and `painter.ai` raises `NoKey`
      (`_ensure_ai_key` re-checks after it closes).
- **Two views** (tabs): the **Dashboard** and the **Log
  (detailed)** (timestamped `[HH:MM:SS]`, both sites interleaved
  with `[gemini]` / `[chatgpt]` prefixes). A SAFETY refusal skips
  only that image (REFUSED in log + report; a rerun retries it). A
  quota stop (`TERMINAL STATE`) stops only that site's queue — the
  other continues. When the site named its reset time
  (`TerminalState.retry_after_s`), the GUI schedules a **QUOTA
  AUTO-RESTART** — reset + a polite random 30–120 s, live
  countdown ("quota — auto-restart in MM:SS") on the site's
  dashboard panel; it fires whenever the app is open. That site's
  Stop cancels the pending restart, its Start just starts earlier
  (cancelling the timer); an unparseable reset keeps the plain
  stop behaviour.
- **Day/Night switch** (top-right, `DayNightSwitch`) — a mini
  image pill ported from the owner's website switch: OFF/left =
  MOON on the dark starfield track (NIGHT = the dark theme),
  ON/right = SUN with a soft glow on the sky-and-clouds track
  (DAY = the light theme). CRISP (owner 2026-07-18): the pill is
  composited from ANTI-ALIASED PIL images — the two tracks straight
  from the website SVGs, the sun/moon knobs rendered supersampled
  with a radial gradient — because tkinter Canvas cannot anti-alias
  raw ovals. A click flips the WHOLE app SYNCHRONOUSLY (coherent
  instantly) and persists the choice, then a ~600 ms smoothstep
  slide runs as flourish. See **Theming**.
- **Settings persistence** (`painter/settings.py`) — remembered
  across starts: the output folder, EVERY per-agent panel setting
  (including each agent's OWN Settings-gear collapse state), the font
  zoom base, the **theme** (`day` / `night`), the window geometry, and
  the **collapsed/expanded** controls state (selection ticks stay
  per-run; the old dashboard `sash` is gone with the PanedWindow, and
  the old TOP-LEVEL `settings_collapsed` from 0.0.079 is gone too — a
  stale key is ignored). The **collection queue is NOT persisted** — the app
  starts with an empty list every launch (owner 2026-07-18); and a
  saved output folder that no longer exists is ignored in favour of
  the default `out/`, so done-detection checks the real output tree
  instead of a stale path. Saves debounce on every meaningful change (var traces —
  the per-agent gear collapse rides a BooleanVar so it saves like every
  other field —, zoom, theme flip, the Controls collapse, the two
  remembered dialogs) and always fire on close; loading applies missing
  keys as current defaults (a missing `theme` = `night`, a missing agent
  `settings_collapsed` = True) and drops queued files that no longer
  exist (reported in the log). The stored dict: `output`, `font_base`,
  `theme`, `geometry`, `controls_collapsed`, `gemini_api_key` (the AI
  features' credential, owner 2026-07-20 — held on the GUI so the
  whole-dict save round-trips it; the wizard's Save persists
  IMMEDIATELY via `set_gemini_key` → `_save_now`, since `painter.ai`
  reads the key back from disk per call), `upscale_tool`
  (the standalone Upscale dialog's last-used `min_width`/`min_height`/
  `aspect_min`/`aspect_max`), `aspect_ratio` (the last `[W, H]` from
  the Aspect dialog), `aspect_filter` (that dialog's last input filter —
  `from`/`to`/`mode`), and `agents.<site>` with `background`, `style`
  (the rendering-style dropdown), `bg_removal`, `crop`, `upscale`,
  `report`, `safer_retry`, `continue_nudge`, `new_chat`,
  `pause_min/max`, `act_min/max`,
  the per-agent upscale-gate `up_minw`/`up_minh`/`up_aspmin`/`up_aspmax`,
  and that agent's `settings_collapsed`.

## The Dashboard — per-JOB panels (owner 2026-07-19)
The dashboard shows one panel PER RUNNING JOB, up to SEVEN in parallel:
the two generation SITES (ChatGPT, Gemini), the four in-place TOOLS
(BG removal, Crop, Upscale, Aspect ratio) and the AI CHECKER (owner
2026-07-20). Panels are no longer fixed —
a panel APPEARS when its job STARTS (a site Start / a tool button) and
gets a **✕ Close** button when the job FINISHES; Close removes the
panel from the grid AND clears that job's temp backups. Only
running-or-ran jobs show.

**`JobPanel`** is the shared base: a coloured header (an ICON via
`config.JOB_LOGO` + `icon()` — a brand logo for the two sites, a
dedicated PNG for each of the four tools, owner 2026-07-19 — plus the
job NAME in the job's `(day, night)` `JOB_COLORS` pair), the muted state
line (quota countdown / current item / paused), an OPTIONAL `btn_pause`
(owner 2026-07-21 — built only when the panel is constructed with
`on_pause`; a plain `kind="secondary"` button whose label alone flips
Pause ↔ Resume, beside Close in the header) and the
hidden CLOSE button `finish()` reveals / `reset_finished()` hides.
`set_paused(is_paused)` is the shared visual update both
`_toggle_pause_job` and a panel's own construction rely on: it always
sets the state line (`"paused — waiting to resume"` / `""`) and, when
`btn_pause` exists, its label. `ToolPanel` and `AiCheckPanel` are
built WITH `on_pause` (their own toggle, since neither has a separate
control panel); `DashPanel` is built WITHOUT it (chatgpt/gemini's
button lives on `AgentPanel` instead — a different class, its OWN
`set_paused` toggling just its `btn_pause` label) — `set_paused` still
works there because `DashPanel` inherits it from `JobPanel`, so the
Dashboard tab's state line reflects a site's pause even though the
BUTTON that caused it lives in the Controls area. See **Pause** below
for the full mechanism. It
also carries the shared root/folder TREE-NODE plumbing
(`_ensure_root` / `_ensure_folder`) for the folder-based panels
(ToolPanel, AiCheckPanel), whose rowed table itself is built by the
module `build_job_tree` helper (Rule #5 — one home for the Treeview +
round scrollbars + theme tags); DashPanel builds its own theme-keyed
nodes and never calls these.
`DashPanel(JobPanel)` is one gen site's view; `ToolPanel(JobPanel)` is
one tool's. Both are BUILT ONCE (never destroyed) and fed ONLY by the
runner/worker's structured events on the main thread.

**`DashGrid`** replaces the old draggable `ttk.PanedWindow`. It holds
the seven build-once panels and re-flows them by ACTIVE COUNT via
`config.GRID_COLS_BY_COUNT` (1→1 col, 2→2, 3→3, 4→2×2, 5→2×3, 6→2×3,
7→3×3;
rows = ceil(N/cols)), row-major over `JOB_ORDER` (gen FIRST) so ChatGPT
+ Gemini always fill the TOP row — at N=5 the 6th cell stays empty.
Cells share a `uniform` group so they are equal and evenly fill the
area; `add(kind)` / `remove(kind)` re-grid live as jobs start / close;
a muted placeholder shows when no job has run yet. The `sash` setting
key is gone (a stale one in an old settings.json is ignored).

**`DashPanel`** (one gen site), header + state line then:
- **Task** — a whole-run progress bar and `done / total
  (done/collections)` across every queued collection (pre-counted at
  Start by `_plan`, which mirrors the runner's queue rule).
- **File / Image** — the current collection file, the current image,
  and a per-collection progress bar.
- **Stats table** — two columns, `This one` and `Whole run`. Rows:
  Done, Refused, a collapsible **Average** (its value is the total
  per-image time; click ▶ to break it into **AI generation**, **Our
  processing** (save+bgfix+pause), **Minimum** and **Maximum**), then
  Tempo (/h) and ETA.
- **Collections (running + done)** — a three-level `ttk.Treeview`
  (Name · Done · AI · Ours · Res · Time · Size, both scrollbars,
  `stretch=False` everywhere): **Collection** → **Folder** →
  **Image**. The running collection appears live and open; **Show**
  (or double-click a row) opens the same formatted viewer — a
  collection's whole file, a folder's sheet excerpt, or an image's
  prompt + the saved image.
- **Status badges** (owner 2026-07-20) — each image row carries small
  coloured DOTS beside its name for what actually HAPPENED to that
  image: green `bg` = BG removed, orange `crop` = cropped, blue
  `upscale` = upscaled, purple `retry` = the one-shot safer retry
  produced it. A post-save step earns its dot ONLY when it really
  CHANGED the file (`config.badge_keys_for` maps the runner's
  `actions` string — a step counts on status `done`, never `nothing`
  / `unclear` / `FAILED`); `retried` comes from the same
  `item_progress`/`item_done` payload. The dots are PIL-DRAWN
  (module `badge_dots`, supersampled + LANCZOS, one cached
  PhotoImage per key-combination) and attached as the row's Treeview
  image — Tk 8.6 on Windows renders colour EMOJI as identical
  monochrome circles (probed live 2026-07-20), so glyph badges were
  not an option; a row image is the only per-row colour a
  `ttk.Treeview` offers and sits LEFT of the name. Colours/labels
  are pure config data (`config.BADGES` — the owner retints there;
  deliberately theme-agnostic mid-tones that read on both the dark
  and the cream tree). A tiny mono-font LEGEND line under the
  Collections header (`● BG removed ● cropped ● upscaled ● safer
  retry`, each label tinted its badge colour) spells them out.

**`ToolPanel`** (one in-place tool), header + state line then:
- a progress bar, an aggregate metric label — `avg N% <metric> ·
  X changed, Y skipped`, where the metric is the tool's own PARAMETER
  (`config.JOB_METRIC`): BG removal `removed` (% removed pixels), Crop
  `reduction` (% area), Upscale `increase` (% area), Aspect ratio
  `deformation` (% growth of the stretched axis) — and a TIME label
  `⏱ <total> total · <avg>/img`. Both the total and the average count
  ONLY images actually PROCESSED (changed); skipped images add no time
  (owner 2026-07-19). Times use `config.fmt_op_duration` (sub-second
  below 10 s — bg/crop/aspect run in fractions of a second — so a fast
  op is `0.2s`, not `fmt_duration`'s flattened `0s`); every % (the avg
  stat AND the per-row column) uses `config.fmt_pct` (2 decimals below
  10, 1 from 10) so a tiny metric reads `0.24%`, not `0%`.
- a **collection → folder → image** `ttk.Treeview`. The dimensional
  tools (Crop / Upscale / Aspect) show Name · Before · After · % · Time
  · Size — each image row its BEFORE / AFTER resolution, the tool's %,
  and its per-image op time. **BG removal DROPS the Before/After
  columns** (owner 2026-07-19): it changes ALPHA, not dimensions, so
  before == after resolution is meaningless — its panel shows Name · % ·
  Time · Size only (`self._is_bg` picks the column set). CHANGED vs
  SKIPPED rows are tinted by TWO theme-aware Treeview tags (owner
  2026-07-19), so they NEVER blur together:
    - a CHANGED (restorable) row carries `TOOL_CHANGED_TAG`, a BOLD
      striking green/teal (`status["toolchanged"]` — `#2ee59d` mint on
      night, `#0a9d6e` emerald on the cream day) that POPS off both
      backgrounds;
    - a refused (no-op) row shows `—` in % and BLANK Time and carries
      `TOOL_SKIP_TAG`, the muted `status["skip"]` (`#adb5bd` night /
      `#8a8578` day). This bucket also holds the many 0px crops the
      crop-fix (SKIPPED iff output resolution == input) routes to skipped.
  Both tags are theme-aware — `skin_tree` registers them in the plain-tk
  skin registry (`_apply_tree_skin`) so they re-tint on a Day/Night flip.
- **Double-click an image row** opens a `BeforeAfterWindow` for that
  image with a **Restore** (reverts ONLY it); **double-click a FOLDER
  node** opens a viewer of ONLY that folder's changed images (title names
  the folder + count) with **RESTORE ALL** reverting JUST that folder
  (`rels_in_folder` filters `_image_rows` by `folder_of`; `restore_folder`
  restores only those rels — owner 2026-07-19, the fix for a folder click
  that used to revert the WHOLE job); **double-click the collection (top)
  node** still opens ALL the job's changed images with a whole-job RESTORE
  ALL. A restore marks the row(s) restored and puts the ORIGINAL back on
  disk (see below). Works for ALL four tools — BG removal included: it
  changes ALPHA, not dimensions, and the viewer keys off the BACKUP
  existing (never a resolution change), so a cleared-background image
  shows before/after just like a resized one.

### Temp / before-after / restore
Every tool job holds a `painter.jobtemp.JobTemp` (a per-slot subdir
under the gitignored `.painter_tmp/` project temp). The worker
`backup`s each ORIGINAL before the op; on `done` (the file was actually
rewritten) it `measure`s before→after (the metric shown) and keeps the
backup, on a no-op it `drop`s the backup. The `BeforeAfterWindow` (a
themed Toplevel like DocWindow — skinned, registered in
`THEME_TOPLEVELS`, holding its scaled PhotoImages via the shared
`_scaled_photo` helper) stacks each image's before + after. The AFTER of
a BG removal / crop is TRANSPARENT where the background was cleared;
drawn straight onto the panel colour it looks unchanged, so the viewer
composites any image WITH ALPHA over a neutral checkerboard
(`_scaled_photo(..., on_checker=True)` → `_checkerboard` /
`_has_alpha`, greys in `config.CHECKER_*`) — the removed area reads as
removed. Restore / RESTORE ALL delegate to the `JobTemp`. Temp is
CLEARED on the panel's CLOSE, on app exit (`_on_close`) and swept at
startup — gen jobs make NEW files, so they need no restore.

### `AiCheckPanel` — the AI image checker (owner 2026-07-20)
The seventh job slot (`aicheck`, rose `JOB_COLORS`, the `ai` png).
**AI check…** gates on the key (`_ensure_ai_key` — the wizard
auto-opens on `NoKey`), picks a FOLDER, confirms (the run is
READ-ONLY but costs paced free-tier calls, ~`AI_CALL_PAUSE_S` s per
image) and starts `_run_ai_check_job` on its own worker (registered
in `_tool_workers["aicheck"]`, so the one-job-per-kind guard and the
`__tool_done__` plumbing are reused as-is). The worker first
`prune_stale_flags` (a REGENERATED file's changed mtime drops its old
flag), then per image calls `ai.check_one_image` (the pure driver —
it times the call, retries transient 503/429 failures, parses the
strict OK/DEFECTS answer, merges/clears the flag and does the
FLAGGED/FAIL logging) and maps its `kind` to a row:

- **flagged** → `ai.record_flag` (merged into
  `<out>/_state/ai_flags.json`: defects, the verbatim raw response,
  checked_at, model, the file's mtime) + a STRIKING row
  (`TOOL_CHANGED_TAG`) whose metric is the DEFECT COUNT plus the first
  defect text;
- **OK** → `ai.clear_flag` (a fixed image loses its stale flag) + a
  muted row (`TOOL_SKIP_TAG`);
- a per-image `AiError` (a 503 that survives the retries, a malformed
  answer) is LOUD in the log, counted as an error row, and never kills
  the batch (the tool-job convention).

Every row carries its own op **Time** column (`fmt_op_duration`), and
the panel's stat line shows the total + per-image average over the
CHECKED images (`fmt_time_summary`, shared with the tool panels) — the
owner wanted to see how long the paced checker actually works,
retries included.

The flag KEY is the image's path RELATIVE to the shared Output base
(`ai.flag_key`; absolute for an outside image — persists, but can
never match a queued collection). **Double-click ANY checked row**
(flagged, OK or error) → a `DocWindow` (`ai_check_doc_md`) with the
parsed defects (when any), the **verbatim** AI response under "Full AI
response:" and the image itself — so the owner sees exactly what the
model said about this exact image (the raw response also resolves the
"is this the right image?" doubt: the viewer opens `ai.flag_file`, the
same round-trip the worker's `flag_key` reverses). Two panel actions:

- **Send flagged to generator** → `_resend_flagged`:
  `ai.plan_resend` (pure, GUI-free) reverses each flag key to its
  `(drop_path, site)` (the `dest_for` reverse), matches it against
  the QUEUED sheets' items and returns the per-site plan; each
  matched site is started with
  `_start_site(site, override_selection={sheet: drops},
  extra_suffix={drop: ai.fix_note(defects)})` — the regenerate path
  (`only=` overwrites the flawed file) with the "previous attempt
  had these flaws" note appended per item. An unmatched image and an
  already-running site are LOUD log skips.
- **Clear flags** → `_clear_ai_flags` (`ai.clear_flag_keys`) wipes
  this run's entries and marks the rows `cleared`.

## Theming
Two coordinated palettes — **night** (the built-in `darkly`, kept
byte-for-byte: the owner is happy with the dark look) and **day** (a
custom light theme, the owner's warm-gold website palette) — flipped
as ONE by the top-right `DayNightSwitch`. The single source of truth
is `THEMES` in [Config](painter/config.md): each entry
carries its ttkbootstrap theme name, the customtkinter appearance
mode, the switch knob side, the 16 ttkbootstrap colour keys and a
`status` block (the semantic colours set PER WIDGET at construction).
`config.py` stays framework-free (pure hex data), so the engine and
all tests import it without tkinter/ttkbootstrap.

**The three widget families each flip differently — and each is
covered so NO widget is ever stranded in the other theme** (the bug
the owner caught in an accidental half-light window):

- **customtkinter** — every colour kwarg in the factories is a fixed
  `(day, night)` tuple via `theme_pair()` (and `status_pair()` for
  the solid-button text, `_darken_pair()` for hover shades). CTk
  stores the tuple and re-resolves it per mode, so a single
  `ctk.set_appearance_mode()` repaints EVERY CTk control with zero
  re-walk. `style_action_button` takes a semantic KEY
  (`success`/`danger`) for the same reason — its runtime Start/Stop
  recolour stays a tuple.
- **ttkbootstrap** — `Style().theme_use()` swaps the theme and
  `setup_style()` is re-run (it reads `style.colors` live, so it
  reproduces the named styles in the new palette). ttk looks styles
  up at draw time, so this updates every style-driven widget with no
  per-widget work. The custom `painter_day` theme is registered ONCE
  at startup (`register_painter_day`, idempotent) via
  `Style().register_theme(ThemeDefinition(...))`.
- **plain tk** (Text / Listbox / Canvas / Toplevel) — created through
  `skin_text` / `skin_listbox` / `skin_canvas` / `skin_toplevel`,
  which colour the widget AND append `(widget, role)` to the flat
  `THEMED_TK` registry; `recolor_tk_registry()` re-walks it on a
  flip, re-applying each role's skin and pruning dead widgets via
  `tk.TclError`. This is the ONLY place plain-tk colours live.

**`apply_theme(name, animate=False)`** is the ONE coherent flip, used
by BOTH startup and the toggle. Its core (`_apply_theme_now`): set the
module `ACTIVE_THEME` → `theme_use` → `setup_style()` →
`set_appearance_mode()` → `recolor_tk_registry()` → fire every open
Toplevel's `apply_theme()`. It NEVER tears down the window, so an
active run's worker threads, dashboard counters and quota countdowns
survive a flip. **Open Toplevels** (`SelectWindow`, `DocWindow`) each
register in `THEME_TOPLEVELS` on `__init__`, unregister on
`<Destroy>`, and expose their own `apply_theme()` — because their
per-widget foregrounds (Select tree leaf colours + the header progress
label, DocWindow's Text tags) do NOT follow ttk styles and must be
recomputed from `status()`/`colors` live (Select retains each leaf's
`advice` + `n_done` to recompute its colour).

**The snapshot cover — `smooth_transition(root, mutate, ...)`** (owner
2026-07-20, generalizing the 2026-07-18 theme cross-fade into ONE
shared mechanism, Rule #5): tkinter has no native colour transitions
and cannot animate a relayout, so a live theme flip repaints as an
ugly cascade of half-themed frames and a big collapse/expand or a
maximize/restore lands as one hard jump. The shared helper hides all
of these: `_snapshot_overlay` grabs the CURRENT window client area
with `PIL.ImageGrab` (from `winfo_rootx/rooty/width/height`) into an
`ImageTk.PhotoImage` (held on the overlay so tk cannot GC it) and
mounts it in a borderless, topmost, `overrideredirect` Toplevel placed
exactly over the window at `-alpha` 1.0; an optional
`icon_factory(w, h)` composites a PIL image centred INTO the grab.
Order matters (owner 2026-07-19, the flash fix): the overlay is FORCED
fully mapped + painted first — `deiconify` → `lift` →
`update_idletasks` → `update()` (so DWM actually paints the cover on
screen) — ONLY THEN does the `mutate` callback run (the theme repaint
/ the relayout) UNDERNEATH the cover, one forced `update_idletasks`
settles it invisibly, and `_fade_out_overlay` ramps the overlay's
window `-alpha` 1.0 → 0.0 (ease-out) before destroying it. Wired to
FOUR places: the **theme flip** (`apply_theme(animate=True)` passes
`icon_factory` = the NEXT theme's big sun/moon via
`_render_theme_cover_icon` at `SWITCH_COVER_ICON_FRAC` = 30 % of the
window's min dimension, and the ceremonial `SWITCH_FADE_MS` ≈ 500 ms /
`SWITCH_FADE_STEPS` 28 timing), the **▾ Controls collapse**
(`_toggle_collapsed`), each agent's **Settings gear**
(`_toggle_settings`) and the **maximize/restore** jump
(`_on_root_configure`) — the last three icon-less on the snappier
default `TRANSITION_FADE_MS` (260 ms) / `TRANSITION_FADE_STEPS` (14).
It is a pure visual nicety: with no window on screen
(`winfo_ismapped`/`winfo_viewable`) or on ANY cover failure
(ImageGrab unavailable, `-alpha` unsupported) the mutate simply runs
instantly with a one-line log note, any partial overlay destroyed
(root Rule #1 — the cover can never be the reason a toggle stops
working); a mutate exception is NEVER masked — it propagates loudly
while the overlay still fades out via the `finally`. Caveats:
`ImageGrab` grabs SCREEN pixels, so a window occluding ours is
captured in the snapshot — on MAXIMIZE the grab covers the NEW
(bigger) rect, so other windows' pixels ride the cover for its 260 ms
(they were already visible right there, so nothing leaks; it reads as
a full-screen dissolve into the maximized app); and the app shows a
static snapshot for the fade, so live dashboard updates are briefly
hidden. Startup passes `animate=False` (no window yet) — instant
flip, no overlay.

**Startup order** (`PainterGui.__init__`) applies the saved theme
BEFORE building any widget — `register_painter_day()` → load settings
→ font zoom → `apply_theme(saved_theme)` → pin a thin top strip
(Day/Night switch + `▾ Controls` toggle) on the `shell`, then wrap
the rest in ONE `fill_height` `ScrollFrame` whose body holds the
collapsible controls, compact strip and the Dashboard/Log notebook →
`_bind_zoom` / `_bind_wheel_routing` / `_set_collapsed(False)` →
`_apply_settings` (which caps the geometry and may restore the
collapsed state). Because the theme is live before the first widget
is born, CTk tuples
resolve to the right end and tk skinners read the active palette — no
first-frame flash, no half-theme window. The chosen theme persists in
`settings.json` (`theme` key, missing = `night`).

**The switch** (`DayNightSwitch(tk.Canvas)`) composites the whole
pill from ANTI-ALIASED PIL images (owner 2026-07-18 — raw tkinter
ovals stair-step). Six images are rendered ONCE at construction and
held on `self._imgs` (so tkinter cannot garbage-collect them): the
two track pills via the icon SVG->PIL path (`_render_switch_track`
rasterizes `switch_night`/`switch_day` from `assets/icons/`), and the
sun/moon knobs in a rest + a 1.05x hover size (`_render_sun_knob` /
`_render_moon_knob` draw a supersampled RGBA radial-gradient disc via
`_radial_disc`, then LANCZOS-down). The MOON is a real moon (owner
2026-07-20, replacing the flat 3-crater disc): 7 craters of varied
sizes (`SWITCH_CRATERS`), each with a subtle alpha-blended lit RIM
ARC on the side facing the light (`SWITCH_CRATER_RIM*`); TERMINATOR
shading — brightness ramps from the `SWITCH_MOON_LIGHT_DIR` limb down
to `SWITCH_MOON_DARK_FLOOR` on the far limb across a smoothstep band
— darkens surface, craters and rims together so the sphere reads lit
from one side; and a deterministic low-amplitude value-noise
MOTTLING (`SWITCH_MOON_NOISE_*` — FIXED seed, identical every build)
adds faint maria. The SUN stays the gold gradient over a blurred
glow. The big theme-cover icon reuses these SAME renderers at ~30 %
of the window (`_render_theme_cover_icon`), so knob and cover
improved together; the night track pill (starfield SVG) is untouched.
It is a FIXED size (it does not follow the font zoom), so once is
enough. Each `_redraw` just re-places the track
`create_image` (hard-swapped night/day at the knob's midpoint) and the
knob `create_image` at the animated x. A click toggles state, calls
`apply_theme(name, animate=True)` (the snapshot cross-fade above) +
`_schedule_save`, then runs a ~36-frame smoothstep `after()` knob slide
(cancel/restart if re-clicked) — the slide runs CONCURRENTLY on the
switch canvas underneath the fade overlay, revealed as the snapshot
fades; hover swaps in the 1.05x knob. A missing track SVG is a loud `FileNotFoundError`
(Rule #1). Its canvas is registered as a `canvas` surface so its
background re-tints with the window — the pill's transparent corners
blend into the top strip in both themes.

## Threading
One worker thread per site, started and stopped INDEPENDENTLY by
its panel's buttons (per-site stop events, and — owner 2026-07-21 —
per-KIND pause events, one per `JOB_ORDER` entry, seven total); each
creates its own
Playwright instance and `SiteDriver` (sync Playwright is
per-thread) and walks the theme queue sequentially. The four TOOLS
add up to four MORE daemon workers (`_run_tool_job`), one per kind
(one job per kind — a second click is refused), and the AI CHECKER a
seventh (`_run_ai_check_job`, same `_tool_workers` bookkeeping), so up
to seven jobs run
CONCURRENTLY; each tool worker only backs up + processes files under
its own picked folder and its own `JobTemp` subdir (disjoint writes;
the checker writes only the flag file under `<out>/_state/`). The AI
DIALOGS (`AiKeyWizard`'s Test, `AiSheetDialog`'s two calls) run their
API work on short-lived daemon threads too, feeding a per-dialog queue
polled with `after` (`_AiDialog` — the workers never touch a widget).
Every worker touches the window ONLY through the single `self._q`
queue drained on the tk timer (`_drain_queue` via `root.after`) — so
every widget mutation runs on the main thread. The drain hands each
message to `_dispatch`; during an ACTIVE drag-resize `__event__`
messages are BUFFERED instead (`_pending_events`) and flushed in
order by `_resize_settled` (owner 2026-07-20 — dashboard tree/label
updates stop re-rendering per drag frame; plain log lines and the
rare control messages still apply immediately). Queue messages:
`('__event__', slot, ev)` routes to `self.panels.get(slot).handle(ev)`
(`.get` is the defensive guard for a late event after a panel closed),
`('__tool_done__', slot)` and `('__worker_done__', key)` reveal the
panel's CLOSE and clear the worker bookkeeping, a quota
`TerminalState` posts its `retry_after_s` the same way and the main
thread schedules the auto-restart via `root.after` (the panel keeps its
countdown, no CLOSE, until the restart or a Stop).

## Pause (owner 2026-07-21)

A per-JOB Pause toggle — ALL SEVEN `JOB_ORDER` kinds, not just the
two gen sites — separate from the pre-existing pace RANGE that
happens to share the word "pause" (`Timing.pause_min_s`/`pause_max_s`,
the random wait between prompts; see **The window** above). `self.
_pause_events: dict[str, threading.Event]` (one per kind) and `self.
_paused: set[str]` (which kinds are currently paused) live on
`PainterGui`, seeded at `__init__`. **`_toggle_pause_job(kind)`** is
the ONE handler wired to every kind's `btn_pause` — `AgentPanel`'s own
(chatgpt/gemini) and `ToolPanel`'s/`AiCheckPanel`'s own (the other
five): it flips the kind's `Event` + membership in `_paused`, then
calls `set_paused(is_paused)` on the AgentPanel (if this kind has one)
AND on `self.panels[kind]` (every kind has a dashboard panel), so both
the button label and the Dashboard tab's state line agree, and logs a
one-line `[kind] paused`/`resumed`.

The actual wait lives in [Run Loop](painter/runner.md)'s
`wait_while_paused(should_pause, should_stop, log, emit)` — a public
function, not a `run_sheet`-only helper, so THREE call sites share the
exact same poll-wait (`config.PAUSE_POLL_INTERVAL_S`, no busy spin):

- `_drive_site` passes `should_pause=pause_event.is_set` into
  `run_sheet` alongside the existing `should_stop=stop_event.is_set` —
  checked between sheet items; a Stop always wins over a pending pause
  (`should_stop` is re-checked on every poll tick inside the wait).
- `_run_tool_job` and `_run_ai_check_job` call `wait_while_paused`
  directly, once per loop iteration, BETWEEN images — with
  `should_stop=None` (neither job has a Stop of its own, so the wait
  simply blocks for Resume; there is nothing for it to lose to).

**Stale-pause hygiene** (owner 2026-07-21): a job that finishes its
LAST item right as Pause was clicked — the for-loop just ends, so the
toggle is never revisited — would otherwise leave a phantom "paused"
button/state on an now-idle panel, and a bad carry-over would silently
pre-pause the NEXT run of that kind. Two guards close this: every
`_start_*` method (`_start_site`, `_start_tool`, `_start_ai_check`)
clears a stale pause for its kind BEFORE spawning the worker (a fresh
Start never begins pre-paused), and the `__worker_done__` /
`__tool_done__` dispatch handlers ALSO clear it the moment a job
finishes (so an idle/finished panel never shows a stale "Resume").
`_stop_site` clears it too when actually stopping a running site —
belt-and-suspenders with the `should_stop` re-check inside the wait,
which already lets a PAUSED run stop promptly either way.

Caveat: `_drive_site`'s OUTER per-collection loop has no pause check
of its own — only `run_sheet`'s per-ITEM loop does. Pausing while the
LAST item of a collection is already generating lets that image
finish and the NEXT collection's `run_sheet` call begin (its own log
line prints) before the pause is honored at ITS first item boundary;
no generation happens in the gap, only a log line's timing looks a
beat early. Scoped out of this phase — the letter of "checked between
items" is satisfied, and the gap is cosmetic, never functional.
